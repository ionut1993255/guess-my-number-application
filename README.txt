Welcome to "Guess My Number" App !!!

This is a game that I developed just for fun.
It's practically a visual implementation of "Divide et Impera" if you think about it.

For this project I added custom fonts to make this game look retro and I used HTML5, 
CSS3 and Javascript ES6 to implement this idea.

We just have one input where we can type in a number between 1 and 20 and the game wants you
to find the random number that it thought of.

If you want to retry the game, you can simply click the "Again" button.

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Hope you have fun !!!
